- Using Java, enabling users to manage personal information records (PIRs) such as tasks, notes, contacts, and events efficiently.
- Implemented MVC architecture to separate concerns, ensuring modularity and maintainability, with components like Model (data handling), View (user interface), and Controller (business logic).
- Integrated file I/O operations for importing/exporting records in .pim format, ensuring data persistence and seamless user experience.
- Developed unit tests using JUnit to validate functionality, including record creation, modification, deletion, and search operations, achieving robust system performance.
